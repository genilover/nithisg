          <h4>DESIGN AND SIMULATION OF NFC ANTENNA</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="descrition">
          <p> Near Field Communication (NFC) is emerged in the last decade. NFC is a short range high frequency and low bandwidth wireless communication technology. Passive Radio Frequency identification (RFID) tags are usually used with a system where one end of communication is isolated and powerless in nature. There are several applications of RFID-NFC systems despite of its drawback such as communication can happen between only two devices at a time and, its short range (0-20 cm). </p>

          <h4>DESIGN AND SIMULATION OF FSS ANTENNA</h4>
        </div>
        <div class="descrition">
          <p> This paper proposes an improved Frequency Selective Surface (FSS) unit with Y-shaped ring. It acts as a superstrate layer loaded on microstrip patch antenna. The simulation results show that the gain of 14.43 dB is achieved at 9.5 GHz. With the help of ray theory, the paper analyzes the work mechanism of the new antenna. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional microstrip antenna, the bandwidth of the new antenna does not change after loading superstrate layer. Its directivity is obviously improved, and the nose cone direction gain increases 7.3 dB.</p>
